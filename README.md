# Instagram Clone

This is an Instagram Clone using React Native, Expo and Firebase.
I made this following a tutorial by SimCoder on the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel.

## Installation

Download the code and run **npm install** in your terminal to install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

You also need to install Expo on your computer.
Please refer to the Expo documentation about Installation ([Here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)).

## Run the application

Once Expo is installed on your computer, go in the 'frontend' folder by cd to it.
When you are in the frontend folder, run **expo start -c** in your terminal.

```bash
expo start -c
```

Go to your App Store and install the Expo Go app.
With the app installed, open it and click on **Scan QR Code**, point the camera phone to the QR code shown on the page that opened after executing the command expo start-c and the app will load and be ready for use.
