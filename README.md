# Instagram Clone

This is an Instagram Clone using React Native, Expo and Firebase.
I made this following a tutorial by SimCoder on the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel.

## Installation

Download the code and run **npm install** in your terminal to install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

You also need to install Expo on your computer.
Please refer to the Expo documentation about Installation ([Here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)).

## Run the application

Once Expo is installed on your computer, go in the 'frontend' folder by cd to it.
When you are in the frontend folder, run **expo start -c** in your terminal.

```bash
expo start -c
```

Go to your App Store and install the Expo Go app.
With the app installed, open it and click on **Scan QR Code**, point the camera phone to the QR code shown on the page that opened after executing the command expo start-c and the app will load and be ready for use.

## Screenshots

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

### Special thanks to SimCoder for his amazing tutorials on coding apps like this one. If you wanna learn new technologies like Firebase in my case, I highly recommend you to go to is [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SimpleCoder).
